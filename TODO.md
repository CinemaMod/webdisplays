### Delayed things
* Plugin API
* Center camera to screen when using keyboard
  * Allow actual cursor to be used via aiming it at the screen
  * maybe aim at the focused element instead of the center of the screen, depends on if that information can be extracted
* minePad management: check GuiContainer.draggedStack for minePad
* In-game command to add/remove blacklisted domains
* CC Interface (for when it's actually possible, since the screens are client only currently, but a config option is planned to change that)
* Redstone controls (same reason as CC interface)
* Potentially redo minisrv logic?
  * Perhaps hook it up to vanilla networking
  * Maybe don't use it at all in single player
