# WebDisplays
WebDisplays adds a screen block, which allows you to browse the internet in minecraft.

This project is a fork of montoyo's [WebDisplays](https://github.com/montoyo/webdisplays) mod from 1.12, updated to work in newer versions, and with some bug fixes and reworking.

WebDisplays requires [MCEF](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcef), which is using [CinamaMod's fork of JCEF](https://github.com/CinemaMod/java-cef), which should allow for WD to be a bit more seamless than [Chromium's JCEF](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/java-cef) would allow for.

### Wiki
* A Wiki which details all blocks/items can be found on [montoyo's website](https://montoyo.net/wdwiki/). However, a lot of stuff has changed since that wiki was written.
